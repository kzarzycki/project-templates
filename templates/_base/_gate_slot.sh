# GATE_SLOTS (default 1) is how many gates run at once. A slot is a lock on a file, so it frees
# itself when the command exits, however it exits. GATE_JOBS, exported to the command, is the cores
# free when it starts (online cores minus the 1-minute load average, at least 1): a parallel runner
# reads it, e.g. `pytest -n "$GATE_JOBS"`, instead of adding a worker per core on a loaded host.
